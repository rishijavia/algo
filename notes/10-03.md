## Midterm and still sorting


Pseudo Code for swap:
```
swap(a, i, j)
Input: a - array of items
      i,j- positions to swap
Output: a with arrays swapped

temp <- a[i]
a[i] <- a[j]
a[j] <- temp
```

**Selection sort**

Pseudo code for selection sort:
```
Selection sort (a, n)
Input: a - arrays of items to sort
       n - length of the arrays
Output: natural order of items(keys)

for i <- 0 to N-1 do:
  min <- i
  for j <- i + 1 to N-1 do:
    if a[j] < a[min] then:
      min <- j
  swap(a, i, min)
```

- For selection sort, its `(n^2)` for the best and worst case
- `swap` is constant in best case and linear `(n)` in worst case for selection sort though
- Is not stable

**Insertion sort**

Pseudo Code for Insertion sort:
```
Insertion sort (a, n)
Input: a - arrays of items (keys) to sort
       n - number of items/length of the arrays
Output: sorted array

for i <- 1 to N-1 do:
  j <- i
  while j > 0 and a[j] < a[j-1]
    swap(a, j, j-1)
    j <- j-1
```

- Compared to selection sort `swap` will be input dependent. If input is already sorted then the algo will perform linearly
- In worst case it will perform at `n^2` but in best case it will sort in linear `(n)` time
- In worst case Insertion will do same as Selection sort but in the best case Insertion will do much better than selection
- Is stable
