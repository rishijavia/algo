## Continuing Java Generics

If we have two large Integer Arrays `a[]` and `b[]`.

```
int[] t = a;
a = b;
b = t;
```

This code swaps both the arrays. `a` and `b` are referencing to different spots in memory. A new array `t` now points to a, `a` then points to `b` and then `b` to `t`.

This is a constant time operation. There are three operations here. If it were a for loop it would be a linear time operation and the time will grow with the size of array.

```
Vector [] victor = new Vector [2];
StdOut.println(victor[0].sum() + " " + victor[1].sum()); // the " " will force to a string
```

There are no actual vector objects created here. We have not created any vector at all. This will throw a nullpointer as `victor[0]` is not initialized and is null.

**Type Array**

```
//we can have any amount of diamond variables
Vector <E>
KeyValueSet <K, V, E>

//we can even have subtypes
Vector<E implements comparable>
```
By default it will say that these parameters are bound by object superclass. And can do anything an object can do.

In second case our boundary will be comparable, a level above object class. Inside that class we can use any methods available from comparable.

```
Public Vector<E>
vector(E []);
int size();
E valueAt(int);
```
Class Variables:

```
private final E[] _data;
```

Constructors:

```
Public Vector(E[] a){
  //creating an array of object and typecasting as E[] as you cannot do new E [a.length]
  _data = (E []) new Object[a.length];
  for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++){
    //creating a defensive-copy
    _data[i] = a[i];
  }
}
```

Other methods:

```
Public int size(){
  return _data.length;
}

Public E valueAt(int i){
  _range_check(i);
  return _data[i];
}

Private void _range_check(int i){
  if (i < 0 || i >= size()){
    throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("You suck");
  }
}
```

**Two interfaces we will be using all term**

This will help us do:
```
String [] arr;
for(String s : array){
  //my code
}
```

This is kind of foreach function that loops through each element of the string array.

We can do this because Java has `Iterable` interface. This has an interface called `Iterator<E>` which has a method `boolean hasNext()`, `E next()` and `void remove();`. `remove()` removes the last element accessed by `next()`. This does not take an array.

Inteface `iterable` has an interface `iterator` which has these(^) methods.

Alter vector to use string interface discussed before using sub-classing and sub-typing.

```
Public IterableVector<E> extends Vector<E> implements Iterable<E>

/*
we will have:

Public IterableVector(E [])
int size()
E valueAt()
*/

Iterator<E> iterator();

//inside our constructor we can call superclass
IterableVector(E[] a){
  super(a);  
}

Public Iterator<E> iterator(){
  return new VectorIterator;
}

Private class VectorIterator implements Iterator<E>{
  private int position = 0;

  Public boolean hasNext(){
    return (position < size());
  }

  Public E next(){
    return _data[position++];
  }

  Public void remove(){}
}
```

We have to make our variable `protected final E[] _data;` so that its accessible by `IterableVector` class.

## different type of collection

**Bag**

You can put something in it and never remove it. No ordering, can iterate.
```
Public class Bag <E> implements Iterable<E>{
  Bag()
  add(E)
  iterator()
  Iterator<E> iterator()
}
```

**Queue**

FIFO
```
Public class Queue<E> implements Iterable<E>{
  Queue();
  enqueue(E);
  E dequeue(E);
  boolean isEmpty(); //need it because we dequeue a null element it throws nullpointer and not return null
  size();
}
```

**Stack**
LIFO, push and pop
```
Public class Queue<E> implements Iterable<E>{
  Stack();
  push(E);
  E pop(E);
  boolean isEmpty();
  size();
}
```
