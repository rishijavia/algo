*Addition to last class's notes*

- By default Java's `equals(object)` method checks if both the objects points to the same reference.

## Continuing Java


**Inheritance continued from 08-31**

- Object equality:

For our last class we had a date method, so creating some new dates:

```
Date d1 = new Date(2, 4, 1900);
Date d2 = new Date(4, 11, 2013);
Date d3 = new Date(2, 4, 1900);
if (d1 == d2){
	print("Equal");
}
```

This wouldn't print anything. But if we have:

```
Date d1 = new Date(2, 4, 1900);
Date d2 = new Date(4, 11, 2013);
Date d3 = new Date(2, 4, 1900);
if (d1 == d3){
	print("Equal");
}
```

It depends! This will look at the references, are the d1 and d3 references same? By value they are equal, but they are two distinct object and have different reference so will not print anything. The same will happen with `d1.equals(d3)`.

d1 points to some place in memory which is difference from d3's memory location.

`==` is same as `.equals()` -> Do they have the same reference?

but, if we had:

```
Date d1 = new Date(2, 4, 1900);
Date d2 = new Date(4, 11, 2013);
Date d3 = new Date(2, 4, 1900);
d3 = d1;
if (d1 == d3){
	print("Equal");
}
```

d3 will point at the same memory location as d1 as we set it when we call `d3 = d1` and therefore this will pring `Equal`.

---

**Override .equals() **

We want to consider the values and not reference when we call `d1 == d3`. We use the technique called `overrride`. We use it take the default implementation and instead of using that inherited code, use our custom code instead.

If one overrides `.equals()` they have to make sure they maintain some behavior:

- It should maintain an equivalent relationship. It has to reflexive for example `x.equals(x)` it has to be `true`. 

- It has to be symmetric, if `x.equals(y) <-> y.equals(x)` then it should work both ways. 

- It has to be transitive, for example if `x.equals(y) == y.equals(z) == x.equals(x)`.

Some constraints it should maintain:

- It should maintain null constraint. It should return false for if the object passed is `null`.

- Must be consistent. Paying attention to instance variable if they are mutable or immutable. If `x.equals(y) == true` then if I do it later, it should not change and still be `true`.

---

**Example when symmetry fails**

Animal class

```
public class Animal {

	private final String name;
	
	public Animal(String nm) {
		name=nm;
	}

	/// bad equals implementation
	// dont use instanceof, instead use the getClass() method
	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
		if (this == obj) return true;
		if (obj == null) return false;
		if (obj instanceof Animal) {
			Animal that = (Animal)obj; //take the input object and typecast it as Animal
			if (this.name != that.name) return false;
			return true;
		}
		return false;
	}
}
```

Cat class
```
public class Cat extends Animal {

	private int _meows;
	
	public Cat(String nm) {
		super(nm);
	}
	
	public void meow() { _meows++; }
	
	public int meows() { return _meows; }

	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
		if (this == obj) return true;
		if (obj == null) return false;
		if (obj instanceof Cat) {
			Cat that = (Cat)obj; //take the input object and typecast it as Cat
			return (this._meows == that._meows && super.equals(that));
		}
		return false;
	}	
}
```

`super` in `Cat class` calls the parent `.equals()` method.

Creating new instances:

```
Cat cat = new Cat("tinycat");
Animal animal = new Animal("tinycat");

System.out.println(cat.equals(animal));
System.out.println(animal.equals(cat));
```
This **should print** `false` and `false`. 

This will print `false` and `true`. This is because:

- In first case `cat.equals(animal)` this would violate if `x.equals(y) then y.equals(x)`. Every animal object is not a cat.

- Since cat is a subclass of animal then every cat object is an animal object.

Instead of fixing `instanceOf` method to check objects, we can use `getClass()` method. So our new code will be

```
public class Animal {

	private final String name;
	
	public Animal(String nm) {
		name=nm;
	}

	/// bad equals implementation
	// dont use instanceof, instead use the getClass() method
	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
		if (this == obj) return true;
		if (obj == null) return false;
		if (getClass(this) == getClass(obj)) {
			Animal that = (Animal)obj; //take the input object and typecast it as Animal
			if (this.name != that.name) return false;
			return true;
		}
		return false;
	}
}
```

We use `getClass()` method to check if they both belong to the same class.

Tip: use the `.equals()` method if available to class on a class for the hw.

If we have a class called `IntegerSet`

```
public class IntegerSet {
	
	private final int[] a;
	
	public IntegerSet(int[] keys)
	{			
		a = new int[keys.length];
	    for (int i = 0; i < keys.length; i++)					
	        a[i] = keys[i]; 					// perform defensive copy
	    Arrays.sort(a);			
	}

        public int size() { return a.length; }
							
	  public boolean contains(int key)
	   {  return binary_search(key) != -1;  }
						
	  private int binary_search(int key)
	  {					
	     int lo  = 0;
	     int hi = a.length - 1;
	     while (lo <= hi)
	      { // Key is in a[lo..hi] or not present.				
	         int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
	         if      (key < a[mid]) hi = mid - 1;
	         else if (key > a[mid]) lo = mid + 1;
	         else return mid;				
	
	      }					
	
	     return -1; 
	  }
}
```
*Binary-search*
Search algo which looks at the middle of the array. If we are searching for a key, it will search in the middle and return the location. If not, it will see the value at the center and if its bigger than what we are looking for, it will remove that half and do the same for the part left. It expects the data to be sorted.

We do defensive copy to make an immutable copy of the array.

**Generics**

```
Public class (){
	Vector(int []){
		int valueAt(int);
		int size();
	}
}
```
Vector is limited to ints which could not be desirable if we want to use double at some point. 

Generics can help build Classes which can be used to make one of any datatype. We use `<E>` to as diamond datatype.

```
Public class (<E>){
	Vector(E.[]){
		E valueAt(int);
		int size();
	}
}
```

Now we can use any datatype instead of just int. <E> is a placeholder for any datatype and will be defined by the person who uses the class to specify what type of object they are using. If we date object made from first class.

```
Date [] dates;
Vector <Date> vec = new Vector<Date>(dates);
Vector <Integer> ivec = new Vector<Integer>;
date = vec.valueAt(0);
```

If want to use `sort()` as a property of our class. We have can create a boundary of `<E>` and then implement a generic sort function:

```
Public class (<E implements Comparable>){
	Vector(E.[]){
		E valueAt(int);
		int size();
		sort();
	}
}
```
