*Addition to last class's notes*

- By default Java's `equals(object)` method checks if both the objects points to the same reference.

## Continuing Java


**Inheritance continued from 08-31**

- Object equality:

For our last class we had a date method, so creating some new dates:

```
Date d1 = new Date(2, 4, 1900);
Date d2 = new Date(4, 11, 2013);
Date d3 = new Date(2, 4, 1900);
if (d1 == d2){
	print("Equal");
}
```

This wouldn't print anything. But if we have:

```
Date d1 = new Date(2, 4, 1900);
Date d2 = new Date(4, 11, 2013);
Date d3 = new Date(2, 4, 1900);
if (d1 == d3){
	print("Equal");
}
```

It depends! This will look at the references, are the d1 and d3 references same? By value they are equal, but they are two distinct object and have different reference so will not print anything. The same will happen with `d1.equals(d3)`.

d1 points to some place in memory which is difference from d3's memory location.

`==` is same as `.equals()` -> Do they have the same reference?

but, if we had:

```
Date d1 = new Date(2, 4, 1900);
Date d2 = new Date(4, 11, 2013);
Date d3 = new Date(2, 4, 1900);
d3 = d1;
if (d1 == d3){
	print("Equal");
}
```

d3 will point at the same memory location as d1 as we set it when we call `d3 = d1` and therefore this will printing `Equal`.

**`==` vs `.equals()`**

- `==` -> is a reference comparison, i.e. both objects point to the same memory location

- `.equals()` -> evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects

- equals will only compare what it is written to compare, no more, no less.
- if a class does not override the equals method, then it defaults to the equals(Object o) method of the closest parent class that has overridden this method.
- If no parent classes have provided an override, then it defaults to the method from the ultimate parent class, Object, and so you're left with the Object#equals(Object o) method. Per the Object API this is the same as ==; that is, it returns true if and only if both variables refer to the same object, if their references are one and the same. Thus you will be testing for object equality and not functional equality.
- Always remember to override hashCode if you override equals so as not to "break the contract". As per the API, the result returned from the hashCode() method for two objects must be the same if their equals methods shows that they are equivalent. The converse is not necessarily true.

---

**Override .equals() **

We want to consider the values and not reference when we call `d1 == d3`. We use the technique called `overrride`. We use it take the default implementation and instead of using that inherited code, use our custom code instead.

If one overrides `.equals()` they have to make sure they maintain some behavior:

- It should maintain an equivalent relationship. It has to reflexive for example `x.equals(x)` it has to be `true`.

- It has to be symmetric, if `x.equals(y) <-> y.equals(x)` then it should work both ways.

- It has to be transitive, for example if `x.equals(y) == y.equals(z) == x.equals(x)`.

Some constraints it should maintain:

- It should maintain null constraint. It should return false for if the object passed is `null`.

- Must be consistent. Paying attention to instance variable if they are mutable or immutable. If `x.equals(y) == true` then if I do it later, it should not change and still be `true`.

---

**Example when symmetry fails**

Animal class

```
public class Animal {

	private final String name;

	public Animal(String nm) {
		name=nm;
	}

	/// bad equals implementation
	// dont use instanceof, instead use the getClass() method
	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
		if (this == obj) return true;
		if (obj == null) return false;
		if (obj instanceof Animal) {
			Animal that = (Animal)obj; //take the input object and typecast it as Animal
			if (this.name != that.name) return false;
			return true;
		}
		return false;
	}
}
```

Cat class
```
public class Cat extends Animal {

	private int _meows;

	public Cat(String nm) {
		super(nm);
	}

	public void meow() { _meows++; }

	public int meows() { return _meows; }

	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
		if (this == obj) return true;
		if (obj == null) return false;
		if (obj instanceof Cat) {
			Cat that = (Cat)obj; //take the input object and typecast it as Cat
			return (this._meows == that._meows && super.equals(that));
		}
		return false;
	}
}
```

`super` in `Cat class` calls the parent `.equals()` method.

Creating new instances:

```
Cat cat = new Cat("tinycat");
Animal animal = new Animal("tinycat");

System.out.println(cat.equals(animal));
System.out.println(animal.equals(cat));
```
This **should print** `false` and `false`.

This will print `false` and `true`. This is because:

- In first case `cat.equals(animal)` this would violate if `x.equals(y) then y.equals(x)`. Every animal object is not a cat.

- Since cat is a subclass of animal then every cat object is an animal object.

Instead of fixing `instanceOf` method to check objects, we can use `getClass()` method. So our new code will be

```
public class Animal {

	private final String name;

	public Animal(String nm) {
		name=nm;
	}

	/// bad equals implementation
	// dont use instanceof, instead use the getClass() method
	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
		if (this == obj) return true;
		if (obj == null) return false;
		if (getClass(this) == getClass(obj)) {
			Animal that = (Animal)obj; //take the input object and typecast it as Animal
			if (this.name != that.name) return false;
			return true;
		}
		return false;
	}
}
```

We use `getClass()` method to check if they both belong to the same class.

Tip: use the `.equals()` method if available to class on a class for the hw.

If we have a class called `IntegerSet`

```
public class IntegerSet {

	private final int[] a;

	public IntegerSet(int[] keys)
	{			
		a = new int[keys.length];
	    for (int i = 0; i < keys.length; i++)					
	        a[i] = keys[i]; 					// perform defensive copy
	    Arrays.sort(a);			
	}

        public int size() { return a.length; }

	  public boolean contains(int key)
	   {  return binary_search(key) != -1;  }

	  private int binary_search(int key)
	  {					
	     int lo  = 0;
	     int hi = a.length - 1;
	     while (lo <= hi)
	      { // Key is in a[lo..hi] or not present.				
	         int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
	         if      (key < a[mid]) hi = mid - 1;
	         else if (key > a[mid]) lo = mid + 1;
	         else return mid;				

	      }					

	     return -1;
	  }
}
```
*Binary-search*
Search algo which looks at the middle of the array. If we are searching for a key, it will search in the middle and return the location. If not, it will see the value at the center and if its bigger than what we are looking for, it will remove that half and do the same for the part left. It expects the data to be sorted.

We do defensive copy to make an immutable copy of the array.

**Generics**

```
public class (){
	Vector(int []){
		int valueAt(int);
		int size();
	}
}
```
Vector is limited to ints which could not be desirable if we want to use double at some point.

Generics can help build Classes which can be used to make one of any datatype. We use `<E>` to as diamond datatype.

```
public class Vector<E>{
	Vector(E.[]){
		E valueAt(int);
		int size();
	}
}
```

Generic Box class:

```
public class Box<T> {
    // T stands for "Type"
    private T t;

    public void set(T t) { this.t = t; }
    public T get() { return t; }
}
```

Now we can use any datatype instead of just int. <E> is a placeholder for any datatype and will be defined by the person who uses the class to specify what type of object they are using. If we date object made from first class.

```
Date [] dates;
Vector <Date> vec = new Vector<Date>(dates);
Vector <Integer> ivec = new Vector<Integer>;
date = vec.valueAt(0);
```

If want to use `sort()` as a property of our class. We have can create a boundary of `<E>` and then implement a generic sort function:

```
Public class (<E implements Comparable>){
	Vector(E.[]){
		E valueAt(int);
		int size();
		sort();
	}
}
```

**Type Erasure**

Generics were introduced to the Java language to provide tighter type checks at compile time and to support generic programming. To implement generics, the Java compiler applies type erasure to:

- Replace all type parameters in generic types with their bounds or Object if the type parameters are unbounded. The produced bytecode, therefore, contains only ordinary classes, interfaces, and methods.
- Insert type casts if necessary to preserve type safety.
- Generate bridge methods to preserve polymorphism in extended generic types.

Type erasure ensures that no new classes are created for parameterized types; consequently, generics incur no runtime overhead.


**Erasure of Generic Types**

During the type erasure process, the Java compiler erases all type parameters and replaces each with its first bound if the type parameter is bounded, or Object if the type parameter is unbounded.

Consider the following generic class that represents a node in a singly linked list:

```
public class Node<T> {

    private T data;
    private Node<T> next;

    public Node(T data, Node<T> next) }
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    public T getData() { return data; }
    // ...
}
```

Because the type parameter T is unbounded, the Java compiler replaces it with Object:

```
public class Node {

    private Object data;
    private Node next;

    public Node(Object data, Node next) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    public Object getData() { return data; }
    // ...
}
```

In the following example, the generic Node class uses a bounded type parameter:

```
public class Node<T extends Comparable<T>> {

    private T data;
    private Node<T> next;

    public Node(T data, Node<T> next) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    public T getData() { return data; }
    // ...
}
```

The Java compiler replaces the bounded type parameter T with the first bound class, Comparable:

```
public class Node {

    private Comparable data;
    private Node next;

    public Node(Comparable data, Node next) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    public Comparable getData() { return data; }
    // ...
}
```
