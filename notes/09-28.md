## Dynamic Connectivity (continued)

**QuickUnion**

```
find (p)
Input: p integer representing object p
       id array mapping object to # of links
Output: integer component number of p

while(p != id_array[p]) do:
  p <- id_array[p]

return p
```
*Union*

```
Union (p, q, id, s)
Input: object p and q to connect (integers)
      id: array of linkage struct
      s: size
Output: //updates linkage structure

p_root <- find(p)
q_root <= find(q)

if p_root = q_root then:
  return

id[p_root] <- q_root

s <- s -1
```
- Find is input dependent, on link structure which looks like a tree, therefore performance will be based on length of the depth + 1 of the tree
- Union will have 2 * cost of find = 4 (2 for p and 2 for q) and then have one access at `id[p_root] <- q_root`, therefore in will 5 array access

## Sorting

**Compare based sorting Algorithms**

```
Comparable <T>

int compareTo(T)

Input:
Output:
      1:
            0 = v.compareTo(w) when v==w
            -1 = v.compareTo(w) when v < w
            1 = v.compareTo(w) when v > w
      2:
            when v and w are not compatible, Exception is returned
      3:
            when v or w are null, NullPointerException
      4:
            Reflective, Transitive, Symmetric

  int compareTo(Date obj){
    if (this.year > object.year) return 1;
    if (this.year < object.year) return -1;

    if (this.month > object.month) return 1;
    if (this.month < object.month) return -1;

    if (this.date > object.date) return 1;
    if (this.date < object.date) return -1;

    return 0;
  }
}

public class Student implements comparable <student>{
  Student (String first_name, String last_name);
  int compareTo (Student S){
    //String already has built in compareTo function available, so we use that
    return this.last_name.compareTo(S.last_name);
  }
}
