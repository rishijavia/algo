**Algo to evaluate string expression**

Algo to evaluate something like `(1 + (2 - 3))`

Outline for algo:

1. Create two stacks
2. Read from L -> R
3. if read an operand, push to operand stack
4. if read an operator, push to operator stack
5. ignore left parans //its useless because when we encounter closing parans we can figure there will be an opening one
6. reading right parans
  - pop operator
  - # operands
7. perform operation
8. push the result back on operands stack

pseudo code:
```
operators <- new stack
operands <- new stack
.
.
next_item <- read_item()

if next_item is operand then:
  stack_push(operands, next_item)
.
.
```
**Example**

`(1 + ((2 + 3) * (4 * 5)))`

```
Operand     Operator
1              +
2              +
3        <encountered right parans>  So we compute 2 + 3

---

Operand     Operator
1              +
5              *
4              *
5         <encountered right parans> So we compute 4 * 5

---

Operand     Operator
1              +
5              *
20        <encountered right parans> So we compute 20 * 5

---

Operand     Operator
1              +
100       <encountered right parans> So we compute 100 + 1

= 101
```

### LinkedList

Refer: `Stack.java`

```
private class Node{
  E data;
  Node next;
  Node right;
}
```

A new constructor that accepts another stack as input:

```
public Stack(Stack <E> s){
  public Node (Node e){
    item = e.item;
    next = new Node(e.next);
  }
}
```

We add a recursive copier constructor in `Stack.java`

## Order of growth classification

- Constant (`c` `1`) - Program where running time is independent of the size of operators we are running it on. Example `a + b` -> constant time

- Logarithmic - Running time is based on the size of input is expressed by `y = c * log(N)`. Where `N` represents the input size. The `log` is base `2`
  Example: searching through the binary tree, `_binary_search` in `IntegerSet` hw.

  Constant and Logarithmic are more efficient then others:

- Linear - Order of growth is directly proportional to the input size. `y = c * N`. Example: find the maximum value in array, print each character in a string, other single for loop problems

- Linearithmic - `y = c * N * log(N)`, worse then linear but not as bad as quadratic:

- Quadratic - `y = c * (N)^2`. Example: check for all pairs

*BAD STUFF:*

- Cubic - `y = c * (N)^3`

- Exponential - `y = b ^ N` where `b > 1`

**YOU WILL NOT GET IT THE FIRST TIME**
**FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT**

Prove: `T(n) = 5n + 20` is linear `O(n)`:

```
Let n0 = 1
T(n) / O(n) = (5n + 20) / n <= c for all n > 1

Observe the pattern:
1 < n < n^2

From this we can also say:
(5n + 20)/n < (5n + 20n) / n = 25

Let c = 25, n0 = 1

(5n + 20) <= 25n
20 <= 20n -> for all values of n more than 1 this statement is true
```
