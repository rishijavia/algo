## Continuing Sort Algos

**Quick Sort**

- It is a partitioning array
- We want to rearrange the array to enforce the following rules:
  - one value a[j] is in its final place (it would not be moved again and one values will be in its final place) -> Pivot
  - no entry from a[min] (could be a sub array) to a[j-1] is greater than a[j]
  - no entry from a[j+1] to a[max] is less than a[j]

Example -> a = {T I N Y C A T}
assume pivot is a[0] = T:
  - resulting array {C I N T T A Y} -> This is **NOT** partitioned properly as the pivot's value (T) is not at the right place as A is smaller than pivot
  - resulting array {C I N A T T Y} -> Partition is correctly applied as everything to the left of our pivot (T) is smaller than T and everything to the right of pivot is more than T

assume pivot is a[3] = Y:
  - resulting array {T I N T C A Y} -> Partition is correctly applied but our sub arrays will be of size 6 and 1 which is not desirable

**this shows that order of input matters for partition**

**Pseudocode for QuickSort**
```
QuickSort (a, n)
input: a: array to sort
       n: length of the array
output: sorted array

  shuffle(a, n)
  qsort(a, 0, n-1)
```

```
qsort(a, lo, hi)
input: a: array (or partition)
      lo: least/starting positions
      hi: end position
output: sorted array

//stop case:
if (hi <= lo) then:
  return

j <- partition(a, lo, hi) //returns the j position from partition

qsort(a, lo, j-1)
qsort(a, j+1, hi)
```

Example:

`array a = {J O R D B A E R}`
- assumption that a[lo] will be the privot
- partition call will be made from `parition(a, 0, 7)`
- after the partition, 'J' will be in its final resting spot, output = {B E A D J(4th position) R O R }
- qsort (a, 0, 3) ({B E A D})
  - for this qsort:
  - 'B' will be the pivot and output of partition will be = {A B E D}
- qsort (a, 4, 7) ({J R O R})
  - for this qsort:
  - 'J' will be the pivot and output of the partition will be = {J R O R}
- final output - {B E A D J R O R}

**Code for partition**

```java
private static int partition(Comparable[] a, int lo, int hi){
  int i = lo, j = hi + 1; //left and right scan indices
  Comparable v = a[lo]; //select the pivot
  while(true)
  { //Scan right, scan left, change for scan complete, and exchange.
    while(less(a[++i], v)) if (i == hi) break;
    while(less(v, a[--j])) if (j == lo) break;
    if(i >= j) break;
    exch(a, i, j);
  }
  exch(a, lo, j);
  return j;
}
```

Improvement to partition that gives best case performance for qsort (3 way partitioning)
```
sort(Comparable[]a, int lo, int hi){
  if(hi <- lo) return;
  int lt = lo;
  int gt = hi;
  int i = lo + 1;
  comp v = a[lo]
  while(i <= gt){
    int cmp = a[i].compareTo(v);
      if (cmp < 0){
          swap(lt++, i++)
      }
      else if(cmp > 0){
          swap(gt--, i)
      }
      else{
        i++;
      }
  }
  sort(a, lo, lt-1)
  sort(a, gt+1, hi)
}
```
Midterm:
- java
  - Key Data Structures and Abstract Data Types (static vs non-static access)
  - generics `<T>`
    - type erasure
    - if nothing is given it will set default to object type
    - if its set as `<T extends Comparable>`, it will set as comparable
    - Key interfaces:
      - Comparable
      - Iterator
      - Iterable
    - Mutable/Immutable
  - basic data types:
    - bags - unordered collection (no ordering, etc)
    - queue - enqueue, dequeue, FIFO
    - stack - push, pop, LIFO
- analysis
  - Big O order of growth functions
  - Cost Frequency analysis
  - Build algo x that performs in O(g(n)) in pseudo code
- sorting
  - insertion, selection, merge, quick sort, h-sorting
  - modifying
  - analyzing
  - comparing
