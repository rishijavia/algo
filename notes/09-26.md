## Dynamic Connectivity

**Problem Specification**

1. Input is a sequence of integer pairs where the integer represents some object (p, q)
2. We interpret a pair (p, q) as meaning p is connected to q
3. Connected?
  - Reflective: (p, q)
  - Symmetric: (p, q) (q, p)
  - Transitive: (p, q) (q, r) (p, r)
4. Develop an algo that will filters pairs in the same equivalence class

**Example: **

On notepad

**Union Find**
It will be an abstract data type:
1. Initialization
2. Add connections between objects
3. Identify components/connections between objects (what equivalence class am I?)
4. Given x equivalence class, are you a member? (p, q belongs to X?)
5. Size

```
public class Abstract UnionFind
UnionFind (int N) //number of distinct object, size of our set

void union(int p, int q) //create a connection between p and q

int find(int p) //identify the component, how is it connected. which component/class

boolean connected(int p, int q) // returns true if they are connected

int size() // number of distinct components, in our example 2 (2 diff distinct connection going out)
```

Quick Find: Make find as quick as possible at any expense
 - User an array to maintain the connection information
 - id [p] == id [q] if p, q belongs to X

```
find (p)
Input: p integer representing object p
Output: integer component number of p

QuickFind:
  return id_array[p]; //constant time
```

Union has to traverse the array and transfer any id that is in same component as p

```
union (p, q, s) //performs linear time
Input: integer p and q representing objects p and q, s is the size
Ouput/Effect: p and q are connected (id_array[p] == id_array[q])

p_id <- find(p)
q_id <- find(q)

if p_id == q_id then:
  return s

N <- length of id_array
for i <- 0 to N -1 :
  if (id_array[i] == p_id) do:
    id_array[i] <- q_id

s <- s -1
```

**Example**

`starting array`
0      1       2       3       4       5       6       7       8       9
---
`input(4, 3)`
0      1       2       3       3       5       6       7       8       9
---
`input(3, 8)`
0      1       2       8       8       5       6       7       8       9
---
`input(6, 5)`
0      1       2       8       8       5       5       7       8       9


For QuickFind we have `N+3` or `2N + 1` time penalty for union --> linear in both cases

**QuickUnion**

```
find (p)
Input: p integer representing object p
Output: integer component number of p

while(p != id_array[p]) do:
  p <- id_array[p]

return p
```
