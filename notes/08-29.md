## Pseudocode

*Basic layout:*

```
AlgoName(Params)
Input:
Output:

Code
```

*Find maximum element in an array.*

```
MaxElement(a, n)
Input: Array of integers A
       Size of array n
Output: maximum element in A

CurrentMax = A[0]
for i=1 to n-1 do:
    if A[i] > CurrentMax then:
        CurrentMax = A[i]
return CurrentMax
```

*Basic Syntax*
```
if ...then...[else]
for/while...do....
repeat...until..

## Java VS. C
- Some [Java](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11cheatsheet/) background
- Java does not have unsigned int while C does

```
int abs(int n){
  if (n < 0)
    return -n;
  return n;
}
```
If you pass `abs(Integer.MIN)` the function wouldn't work as it the lowest integer signed and is negative

- Will be using args library available on the classroom website
- Static Method vs. Instance Method
  - Provide Static Method to things that are more like functions. Method that are not specific to an instance.
  - Instance Methods are used to do operation on a data that is specific to an instance (object).
  - `head.increment();` is a Instance Method
  - `Math.abs(-4);` is a Static Method
- Abstract data type:
  Its the ability to expand data types beyond the once we have. Objects?
